## In development

# v.1.6.2
-   Added test references, spacescapes and config files.
-   gen3sis_main tests improved and expanded (92.11% covered).
-   all exported functions of config_handling have tests now (94.34% covered).
-   started to write plotting functions tests. 
-   added gen3sis_space_points for plot_multiple
-   test coverage improved to 80.53%

# v.1.6.1
-   Changed run_simulation() [genesis_main.R] code to only load the distance matrix
    every timestep if needed, i.e., if the spacescape is geodynamic. If it is not,
    the function will only load the distance matrix once at the beginning of the simulation.
-   Substituted the raster package functions with terra package functions in
    the plot_summary() [plotting_functions.R] code. The raster package is deprecated and
    the terra package is the new standard for working with spatial data in R.

# v.1.6

-   Manually defining gen3sis$general$config_name variable is no longer required. The "config_name" parameter to create_input_config(), which allows users to specify the name of the configuration object to be created. It is optional. If not provided, the function will either assume the name based on the loaded file name or generate a random unique code.
-   Simulation related console outputs were reworked to improve readability. They are now prettier and more user friendly.
-   config_verify() output messages were reworked to improve readability. They are now more informative.
-   Issue fixed: config file is now copied to output folder when using a gen3sis_config object.
-   Many outdated references to "gen3sis" were substituted by "gen3sis2". Further work needed.
-   The documentation were updated accordingly to the changes above.

# v.1.5.12

-   restore functionality to restart a simulation from a saved state
-   if a config object is used to run a simulation, it is now required to define the gen3sis$general$config_name variable with the name of the subdirectory where the outputs of an individual simulation will be saved (if the config object is created from a config file, this variable will be automatically set from the file name)
-   fix bug in verify_config() where missing settings were not properly identified

# v.1.5.11 release 11.2023

-   fix comb phylogeny
-   color deficient, blind and B&W safe colours
-   speed-up of loop_ecology function
-   fix nexus phylo file format
-   fix accounting of extinctions times
-   fix phylo checks if simulation did not end at t=0
-   fix package build notes citation and class comparisons

# v.1.4 release 10.2021

-   fix bracket compatibility with new R version
-   added new abundance plotting function

# v.1.3 release 07.2021

# v.1.2 release 12.2020

# v.1.1 release 08.2020

# v.1.0 release 06.2020
