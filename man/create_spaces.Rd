\arguments{
\item{env}{named list of environmental variables in a with X,Y, and time-steps from
the most recent of future time-step}

\item{type}{string with type of gen3sis spaces. Accepted values are \code{check_spaces()$type}}

\item{duration}{list containing information on temporal dimension list(from, to, by, unit)
*from* is the oldest time-step; negative number if starting in the past, zero if starting in the present
*to* CAN ONLY BE smaller than *from*, since *to* is the latest time
*by* is the time interval increment. Note that this is constant and can only be positive;
*unit* is the time unit used. Accepted units are \code{check_spaces()$duration}
e.g. list(-20, 0, 1, "Ma") has a space that covers the last 20 Ma until the present, every 1 Ma.
     list(-800, 300, 10, "mil") has a space that covers the last 800 kyra or mil for millions of years
     and goes until the future 300 kya at every 100 mil years.}

\item{area}{list containing information on the 2D spacial dimension: list(extent, total_area, n_sites, unit)
*extent* is a named vector with (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) \code{terra::ext},
*total_area* is the covered area by the points, raster or h3 grid, 
*n_sites* is the number of sites and 
*unit* is theunit  of the area, accepted units are square meter (m2) and square kilometer (km2) 
\code{check_spaces()$area}}

\item{crs}{Coordinate Reference Systems, as string and PROJ.4 format. Default is,
WGS 84 -- WGS84 - World Geodetic System 1984 crs="+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"}

\item{cost_function}{list of cost_function(s) used to calculate the cost distances between sites.
Depends on type and other methods used to calculate the cost distances.}

\item{geodynamic}{boolean for if sites change location or disappear over time
,default is NULL and deduces from NA over time. If false, only one cost_distance is calculated and used
i.e. whencost_distances are the same, i.e. no geodynamic changes in the space}

\item{type_spec}{list containing type specific information, e.g. res (resolution) for raster and h3 spaces}

\item{author}{string with the name of the author. Default is NULL which gives the system user name obtained from \code{Sys.info()["user"]}
This is far from ideal, but it is better than nothing. Please fill this up and even consider leaving a contact information}

\item{source}{string with the source of the data, ideally should contain a publication with DOI and a valid URL
Default is list(env="missing", methods="missing")}

\item{description}{list with "env" and "methods" containing information on the environmental data,
methods used and other relevant information such as source to raw data. Default is list("missing"
The "env" should describe the environmental data used, including it's units}
